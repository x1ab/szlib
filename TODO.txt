- Building tests is way too cumbersome, with the horrid experimental support
  code needed for that only being present in toggle_action.hh currently...
  Anyway, to test a particular header:

	busybox make "CFLAGS_=-DUNIT_TEST -include toggle_action.hh"

  or, for MSVC:
	
	bbuild-msvc "CFLAGS_=/DUNIT_TEST /FItoggle_action.hh"

  Then just run `test.cmd` in the repo root -- it should execute the
  latest file named `*test*.exe` (or nothing if missing).

- Building a unit test should clean the prev. build results first!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  OLD STUFF, NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF THIS IS STILL RELEVANT:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- `build test=module` doesn't clean & recompile first! It just relinks
  modul.exe with all the existing objects! :)

  There should be a `test` target, which would link all objs to separate
  executables by default, or `make test=some-module` could also just
  build that one exe (so no multiple mains...), or even inferecen rules
  could check for that name (in the command block/recipe) and only define
  UNIT_TEST for a matching name.
  Same names in multiple dirs would still fail with these approaches tho.

  - If the test sources are kept in separete files, then those should be
    collected separately (not with the current catch-all SOURCES != ...),
    via distinct dir and/or name patterns.

  - Embedding the tests into the sources of header-only (i.e. most) modules
    would mean LOTS of "garbage" in the released material, unless an extra
    build step could remove them. (OTOH, I'm trying to blur away "header-
    only-ness" anyway, and then that distinction won't matter much.)

- The exp. release dir is already outdated (since I dropped my funny
  filename extensions, for the shortness of life & dumbness of tools)!
