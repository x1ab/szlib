The build is completely broken!

Both the lib build (no lib, no test main; doesn't put anything to `./release`,
which it won't even try create - the current Makefile is not yet adapted!),
and the (one existing) test case build, too!....

Also, the current lib build (Makefile) still uses PDPMake from BusyBox, not
gnumake, even though it's already the tool for the test cases...
