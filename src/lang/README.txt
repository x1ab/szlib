Utilities closely related to the current implementation language

Note: Nothing here is allowed to invoke anything outside of this
      dir, as an arbitrary encapsulation rule hereby proclaimed...

Extra utilities that are "markedly" specific to the implementation
language may probably go to the e.g. an `ext` subfolder. Can't decide
yet... Needs longer-term test-driving.
