Utilities closely related to the current implementation language

The general (but insufficient!) selection criteria for this collection:
ubiquitous stuff that really should be in the language, but isn't.

(Extra utilities (beyond ground-leveling), which are markedly specific
to the implementation language — i.e. things that make no sense for
implementations in other languages — could go into an `ext` subfolder,
I guess...)

Note:
	Nothing here is allowed to invoke anything outside of this
	dir. (As an arbitrary encapsulation rule hereby decreed.)
