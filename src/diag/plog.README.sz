Replaced the local #include <plog/...> paths with "..." and with "../..."
for the ones in subdirs, so that my prefix/proxy header can simply #include
"plog/Log.h", and everything just works, without any build config gymnastics.

(Alas, that could trigger "woah, ".." in include path!" warnings in some
anal mode of certain compilers.)
